# thesandbox.page

Testing ground for web experiments: static Astro, strict TypeScript, deployed to GitHub Pages. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file; edit `AGENTS.md`.

## Workflow

- Never push to `main`; work on a branch and open a pull request into `main`
- Sign every commit; the `main` ruleset rejects unsigned commits
- Keep commits small and focused; PRs merge with a merge commit, so each commit lands on `main`
- Write commit messages as [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org); semantic-release reads them
  - `feat` releases a minor version, `fix` and `perf` a patch, and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer a major. The `!` shorthand (`feat!:`) is not recognized by the release config and releases nothing
  - `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `refactor`, `style`, and `test` release nothing
- Run `pnpm check` and `pnpm build` before pushing; CI runs both as the required `check-and-build` check
- Name branches `<type>/<short-description>`, using a Conventional Commit type (for example `fix/nav-overflow`)
- Required checks: `check-and-build`, `dependency-review`, and CodeQL; no approval is needed except for changes under `.github/` or to `.releaserc.json`, which need the owner's review (`.github/CODEOWNERS`)
- Enable auto-merge on PRs; they merge once checks pass. If a PR from the owner (including `/sandbox` runs) is waiting on code owner review, merge it with the admin bypass after checks pass
- Merging to `main` runs the Production workflow: deploy to GitHub Pages, then semantic-release. Merges by anyone other than the owner wait for owner approval on the `production` environment
- Never push tags; semantic-release creates every version tag
- Releases are git tags plus GitHub releases only; do not edit the `package.json` version or add a CHANGELOG
- Agents stop for a local review before pushing a branch, except scheduled `/sandbox` runs, which ship once checks pass
- Design tokens and shared components go in `src/theme/` (see `src/theme/README.md`)

## The sandbox

- The site itself is the sandbox: anything on it can change. The layout, theme, and home page are a starting point, not a contract
- Kinds of change, most common first:
  - **New**: a new experiment on its own page
  - **Extend**: build on an existing experiment or page
  - **Rework**: redo something with a new technique or platform feature; say why in the PR
  - **Teardown**: replace the home page or shared site chrome; rare
- Experiments live at `src/pages/experiments/<slug>/` with metadata in `src/experiments/<slug>.json` (see `src/experiments/README.md`). They stay up as a showcase; remove one only with a stated reason in the PR
- Nothing may cost the owner money. Ideas that need an account, an API key, or a GitHub feature start as an issue
- Versions are home page eras: `feat` for anything new or added, `fix` or `perf` for fixes and polish, and a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer only for a teardown
- Labels live in `.github/labels.yml`. `sandbox` marks issues approved for `/sandbox` runs; only the owner and collaborators apply it, and issue forms must never add it. Run labels: `experiment`, `extend`, `rework`, `teardown`; `sandbox-failed` marks a run that could not pass its checks

## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.
